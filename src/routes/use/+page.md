First and foremost, I reserve all rights to my music. (I just feel more comfortable releasing it in this
way)

The details are pretty simple:

- You must provide attribution to me (lynndova)
- You may not reupload my music verbatim
- You may use my music under the fair use doctrine, including but not limited to the following:
  - Using my music in videos or streams

If it is not clear, I am not a lawyer. The terms outlined here are _usage guidelines_, not a license.

If you are unsure if you may use my music or wish to license my music for your own use, do not hesitate to contact me via email (me at lynndova dot ca).
